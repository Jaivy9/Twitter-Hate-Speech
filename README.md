# Twitter-Hate-Speech Detection

Python, NLP, Flask, Regex, Google Cloab

• Applied Machine Learning Neural Network model that classifies a Tweet to be : Hate Speech , Offensive language , Neither.
• The Dataset is taken from the research paper published ’Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language’ under : Thomas Davidson,Dana Warmsley,Michael Macy,Ingmar Weber’ namely ”HSOL Twitter.csv.”
• Created a Neural Network using TensorFlow to detect hate speech and loaded the pre-word embedding’s (GloVe embeddings) to prepare a corresponding embedding matrix that can be used in a Keras Embedding layer.
• Data cleaning and Text pre-processing of tweets are done using NTLK, Regex, Stemming , Lemmatization and tokenization and Visualization using Matplotlib and Pandas Profiling .
• Implemented BERT(language model) and K-Train(Wrapper Keras/TensorFlow) with an Accuracy Score of 87 percent .
